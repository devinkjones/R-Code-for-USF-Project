## Creating combined 'Species' by 'MonitoringSite' lists

## Libraries needed to complete merge
library(reshape)
library(reshape2)
library(dbplyr)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)

## Set columns of interest to a dataframe
Datasheet1 <- ("Columns of interest")
Datasheet1

## Reorganize the dataframe of interest to 'MonitoringSiteID' by 'Species/TaxonName' with the associated counts
LocBySpecies <- dcast(Datasheet1, MonitoringSiteID ~ TaxonName, value.var = "Count")
LocBySpecies

## Merge the reorganized dataframe with the 'MonitoringSiteID' from the "Site Only" datafile containing the ID, GPS coords, etc.
## Use the 'MonitoringSiteID' datafile as the "x" and the reorganized data as the "y"
Combined <- left_join("MonitoringSiteID File", "LocBySpecies", by = "MonitoringSiteID")
Combined

## Results in combined datasets; For each 'MonitoringSiteID', you'll now have all species collected/ID'd associated with it
## NA represents those species that are not found at that site
