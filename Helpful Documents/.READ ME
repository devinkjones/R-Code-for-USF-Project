## Helpful documents to discern information in the USGS NAWQA databases

Contents: 

1) USGSPCode_ParamterCodes.xlsx
This Excel file with various worksheets, including 'Physical Parameter Codes', 'BioData Phys Habitat Sampler Cd', 'All Parameter Codes', 'All Method Codes for Param Code', 'readNWISqw OutputNames', 'BioData - AqBioAssess Summaries'

'Physical Parameter Codes'
Includes an abbreviated list of 'Parameter Codes' that includes 'Physical' parameters, their names, and respective units

'BioData Phys Habitat Sampler Cd'
Includes list of Invertebrate Habitat Sampler codes that are used as part of the USGS BioData / NAWQA efforts
List may not be complete; Sampler codes extracted from Moulton et al. 2002 Revised Protocols for Sampling Algal, Invertebrate, and Fish Communities as Part of the National Water-Quality Assessment Program. USGS Open-File Report 02-150 Reston, VA, USA.

'All Parameter Codes'
Includes table of all parameter codes, descriptions, and units
Taken from: https://help.waterdata.usgs.gov/parameter_cd?group_cd=%

'All Method Codes for Param Code'
Includes a table of Method Codes (methods used to determine/measure/analyze Parameter values)
'meth_cd' describes the Method Code used for a specific 'parm_cd'

'readNWISqw OutputNames'
List of 'names' from NWIS datasets
List of codes and descriptors for columns found in NWIS datasets

2) NAWQA_Invert_IQMH_2002_Wade.pdf
Moulton et al. 2002 Revised Protocols for Sampling Algal, Invertebrate, and Fish Communities as Part of the National Water-Quality Assessment Program. USGS Open-File Report 02-150 Reston, VA, USA.

.pdf that includes the protocols for sampling invertebrate, algae, and fish communities and habitats for the USGS BioData/NAWQA projects

3) DataDictionary_BioData_V1.docx
The data dictionary for BioData datasets downloaded from the USGS BioData Retrieval website
Gives all of the (short) definitions of column labels ('names') of datasets downloaded through the Retrieval website
Does not include some of the finer details regarding what values/labels mean within those columns, though

4) Sprague et al. 2017
Handling data and challenges that are priorities when synthesizing large data/publically available datasets
